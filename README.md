## 👁️ What Is the Shatterline Wallhack?

**Wallhack**, also known as **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, is a cheat that overlays player data on your screen — even when enemies are behind walls, objects, or completely out of sight.

It displays outlines, bones, weapon info, distance, health bars, and more — giving you the awareness of a UAV on steroids. 🧠

## 🧠 Core Wallhack Features

* 🔴 **Player ESP** – See enemies through walls with full outlines
* 🟢 **Health Bar Display** – Track how weak or strong each target is before peeking
* ⚙️ **Distance Tags** – Know exactly how far enemies are from your crosshair
* 💡 **Glow ESP** – Enemies are always highlighted with glowing color overlays
* 🎮 **Custom Colors** – Friendly vs. enemy outlines, low-health indicators
* 📏 **Visible/Invisible Line** – Know if an enemy has line-of-sight or not
* 🎯 **Head & Bone Markers** – Aim pre-aligned even behind cover
* 🔊 **Alert Triggers** – Optional ping when enemies are within range

All of this shows live during gameplay — whether you're running, aiming, or scoping up.
